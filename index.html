  <h1>History of Black Hair Styles</h1>
  <div class="intro-header">A journey through the rich history and cultural significance of Black hair.</p>
</div>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="intro-summary">
   Black hairstyles have served as vital cultural markers from ancient Africa to the 
   modern day. In ancient societies, elaborate braids and coils communicated social status, wealth, and spiritual 
   roles. This tradition was later suppressed during slavery, yet styles like cornrows were adapted for protection
   and cultural preservation. Today, styles like the Afro, locs, and various braids are potent symbols of Black identity,
   pride, and resistance against conventional beauty standards.

  <h2>Ancient Hairstyles</h2>
  <div class="summary">In ancient Africa, hair was a powerful visual language used to communicate age, status, wealth, and spiritual roles. 
   Intricate styles like braids and coils, often decorated with beads, were sacred and the process of styling was a key cultural ritual. 
   This established the tradition of Black hairstyles as deeply symbolic.

  <h2>Colonial Era</h2>
  <div class="colonial-era">
    European slavers shaved Africans' heads to violently strip their identity and culture. 
    Enslaved people adapted: they used cornrows for protection and, reportedly, as secret escape maps. 
    This trauma cemented a Eurocentric standard that deemed Afro-textured hair as inferior, favoring straight hair.
  </div>
  <h2>20th Century to Present</h2>
  <div class="present">The 20th century saw the Afro become a symbol of Black Pride during the Civil Rights Movement, rejecting assimilation. 
  After decades of chemical straightening, the Natural Hair Movement has emerged in the 21st century, embracing locs, braids, 
  and natural texture as a powerful, social-media-driven act of self-love and resistance against lingering hair bias.
