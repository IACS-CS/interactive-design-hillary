        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="intro-summary">
          Black hairstyles have served as vital cultural markers from ancient
          Africa to the modern day. In ancient societies, elaborate braids and
          coils communicated social status, wealth, and spiritual roles. This
          tradition was later suppressed during slavery, yet styles like
          cornrows were adapted for protection and cultural preservation. Today,
          styles like the Afro, locs, and various braids are potent symbols of
          Black identity, pride, and resistance against conventional beauty
          standards.

        <h2>Ancient Hairstyles</h2>
        <div class="summary">
          In ancient Africa, hair was a powerful visual language used to
          communicate age, status, wealth, and spiritual roles. Intricate styles
          like braids and coils, often decorated with beads, were sacred and the
          process of styling was a key cultural ritual. This established the
          tradition of Black hairstyles as deeply symbolic.

              <div class="explanation">
                Fun fact: different hairstyles in ancient Africa could indicate
                a person's tribe, marital status, age, wealth, and social
                position.

        <h2>Colonial Era</h2>
        <div class="colonial-era">
          European slavers shaved Africans' heads to violently strip their
          identity and culture. Enslaved people adapted: they used cornrows for
          protection and, reportedly, as secret escape maps. This trauma
          cemented a Eurocentric standard that deemed Afro-textured hair as
          inferior, favoring straight hair.

            <div class="flipper-back">
              <div class="explanation">
                Cornrows were not only practical for hair protection but were a
                great use of storage space if they packed food for escaping.

      <h2>20th Century to Present</h2>
      <div class="present">
        The 20th century saw the Afro become a symbol of Black Pride during the
        Civil Rights Movement, rejecting assimilation. After decades of chemical
        straightening, the Natural Hair Movement has emerged in the 21st
        century, embracing locs, braids, and natural texture as a powerful,
        social-media-driven act of self-love and resistance against lingering
        hair bias.

              This is supposed to be a modern hairstyle called twists. Twists can be done in
              many different ways, such as Havana twists, Senegalese twists but AI doesn't know what that is🫲🫤🫱
